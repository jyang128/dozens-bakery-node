# Dozen's Bakery - with Node.js

## Overview

To practice Node.js, I rebuilt the backend of my [other project](https://github.com/jyang128/dozens-bakery) originally built with the LAMP stack.

Live Site (original):
https://dozens.jessicakyang.com/
 
An online storefront for a bakery that sells treats by the dozen.  Visitors can browse the site, add and remove treats from their cart, place an order, and view their confirmation/order summary.

### Future Enhancements
- Refactor to handle cart data with its own route
- User can add reviews with star ratings
- Expand product offering and add filterable categories
- Add image carousel component to support multiple images
- Add email signup option

### Technology

Created with JavaScript, React.js, Fetch API, React Router, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Bootstrap 4, HTML5, and CSS3
